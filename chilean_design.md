DECOLLAGE.CL: A Culturally-Grounded Seeder Data Implementation PlanSection 1: Analysis and Strategy for Chilean Cultural IntegrationThis document outlines the technical implementation and cultural strategy for seeding the core design tables of the DECOLLAGE.CL platform. The objective is to populate the design_styles, color_palettes, room_types, and seasonal_themes tables with data that is deeply rooted in Chilean cultural identity, geography, and traditions. This initiative represents a critical evolution of the platform's content architecture, moving beyond static, hard-coded options to a dynamic, database-driven system that is scalable, maintainable, and capable of evolving with user engagement.1.1. Core Mandate: From prompts.ts to a Living DatabaseThe initial architecture, which likely relied on a static file such as prompts.ts, served its purpose for prototyping and initial launch. However, to build a robust and engaging platform, a transition to a database-centric model is imperative. The provided database schema facilitates this evolution by introducing tables designed not just to store data, but to track its performance and relevance over time.Fields such as usage_count, is_featured, and is_trending within the design_styles table transform a simple list of styles into a dynamic content system. This structure allows the platform to algorithmically identify popular styles, feature curated content, and respond to user behavior in real-time. It lays the groundwork for future enhancements, including user-generated content, A/B testing of prompts, and personalized style recommendations. This migration is a foundational step in transforming the application from a static tool into an intelligent, responsive design partner for the Chilean user.1.2. Foundational Insight: The Symbiosis of Landscape and ArchitectureA thorough analysis of Chilean architecture and design reveals a fundamental principle: aesthetics are inextricably linked to the country's formidable and varied geography. From the arid northern desert to the temperate central valley and the wild southern Patagonia, Chilean design is not merely placed upon the landscape but is a direct response to it.1 This relationship is the cornerstone of the data generation strategy.Chilean architecture has been profoundly shaped by its environment. The constant threat of seismic activity has led to a pragmatic yet elegant structural language, favoring materials and forms that offer resilience.2 In the south, the abundance of native timber has given rise to a unique architectural vernacular, particularly in Chiloé, where shipbuilding techniques are evident in the construction of churches and homes.3 In the central regions, the hacienda style, with its thick adobe walls and central courtyards, is a direct adaptation to the Mediterranean climate, offering refuge from the summer heat.5 Contemporary Chilean architects continue this tradition, creating a distinct form of "rough modernism" that utilizes local materials like wood, concrete, and copper to create structures that frame dramatic views and harmonize with their surroundings.6This deep connection between place and form dictates that the platform's design styles cannot be generic. A style labeled simply "Rustic" would be inauthentic. Instead, a style must be "Rústico Patagónico," evoking the specific materials, climate, and feeling of a shelter in the southern wilderness. This principle of geographic and cultural specificity will guide the creation of all seeder data, ensuring an authentic and resonant user experience.1.3. Strategic Pillars for Seeder Data CreationThe implementation of this culturally-grounded data is organized around four strategic pillars, each corresponding to a core table in the design system.Styles: The design_styles will be defined by a spectrum of authentic Chilean aesthetics. This ranges from the historical roots of colonial haciendas and indigenous Mapuche symbolism to the contemporary "Rough Modernism" that has gained international acclaim. Each style will be tied to a specific region or cultural context.Colors: The color_palettes will be distilled directly from iconic Chilean landscapes and cultural phenomena. Instead of abstract color theory, palettes will be named and composed based on tangible, evocative sources like an Atacama sunset, a Patagonian glacier, or the vibrant streets of Valparaíso.Rooms: The room_types will adopt the authentic lexicon of the Chilean home. This involves not only using the correct Spanish terminology but also including uniquely Chilean spaces like the quincho and logia, which are central to the domestic life of the target user.Seasons: The seasonal_themes will transcend meteorological seasons to celebrate key cultural moments. The themes will be built around major holidays and traditions, such as Fiestas Patrias and Navidad, allowing the platform to engage users with timely and relevant content throughout the year.Section 2: design_styles: From Architectural Heritage to AI PromptsThis section details the data and rationale for populating the design_styles table. The goal is to translate the nuanced concepts of Chilean architecture into structured data and highly effective, descriptive prompts for the AI image generation service. Each style is crafted to be distinct, culturally relevant, and visually compelling.Table 2.1: Summary of Chilean Design Stylescodenamecategorydescriptionmediterraneo_haciendaMediterráneo de HaciendaclasicoA fusion of Spanish Colonial hacienda traditions with a modern Mediterranean aesthetic, common in Chile's central valley.boho_valparaisoBohemio PorteñobohemioAn eclectic, artistic style capturing the vibrant, colorful, and unconventional spirit of Valparaíso's hillside port communities.rustico_patagonicoRústico PatagónicorusticoEmbodies a cozy refuge in the wild landscapes of Patagonia, prioritizing warmth, natural materials like wood and stone, and connection to nature.modernismo_andinoModernismo AndinomodernoA sophisticated, minimalist style blending modern architecture with materials and forms inspired by the Andes and pre-Columbian cultures.sur_chiloteSur Mágico de ChiloérusticoA unique style from the Chiloé archipelago, defined by masterful woodworking, maritime influences, and a sense of magical realism.etnico_mapucheÉtnico Contemporáneo MapuchebohemioA contemporary style that respectfully incorporates the powerful symbolism and aesthetics of Mapuche culture into a modern living space.2.1. Style: mediterraneo_hacienda (Mediterráneo de Hacienda)Cultural Context: This style represents a significant architectural heritage in Chile's central region. It fuses the historical Spanish Colonial "Hacienda" with a lighter, more modern Mediterranean aesthetic. This blend speaks to a lifestyle of heritage, family gatherings, and a deep connection to the agricultural landscape of the central valley. It is a style that feels both grand and grounded, elegant and rustic.Source Integration: The core elements are derived from classic hacienda design: prominent white stucco walls, often with a rough texture; heavy, rustic wood accents in the form of exposed ceiling beams and substantial doors; and floors of red terracotta tile.5 The central courtyard, a key feature for climate control and private outdoor living in traditional haciendas, is a central motif.5 The "Mediterranean" aspect is a contemporary adaptation seen in modern Chilean homes, which lightens the traditionally heavy colonial forms.Data Implementation:code: 'mediterraneo_hacienda'name: 'Mediterráneo de Hacienda'name_en: 'Hacienda Mediterranean'category: 'clasico'description: 'Una fusión del estilo colonial español con la calidez del Mediterráneo.

Style: boho_valparaiso (Bohemio Porteño)Cultural Context: This style aims to capture the unique soul of Valparaíso. It is not just a design choice but a reflection of the city's history as a bustling port, a haven for artists, and a labyrinth of colorful hillside communities. The style is eclectic, creative, and unapologetically vibrant, embracing imperfection and personal history. The use of "Porteño," a common term for an inhabitant of a port city, adds a layer of local authenticity.Source Integration: The primary inspiration is the visual identity of Valparaíso itself—the brightly colored corrugated metal houses, the sprawling murals, and the generally bohemian and artistic atmosphere that permeates the city.9 The aesthetic is built on a foundation of eclecticism, mixing vintage or found objects with contemporary Chilean art, reflecting a home that has evolved over time.Data Implementation:code: 'boho_valparaiso'name: 'Bohemio Porteño'name_en: 'Valparaiso Bohemian'category: 'bohemio'description: 'Inspirado en los colores y el espíritu artístico de Valparaíso.

Style: rustico_patagonico (Rústico Patagónico)Cultural Context: This style is born from the need for shelter in one of the world's most dramatic and challenging landscapes. It embodies the concept of a refugio (refuge), a warm and secure haven against the fierce Patagonian winds and cold. It is a style of substance, prioritizing durability, warmth, and a profound connection to the raw, untamed nature outside.Source Integration: The material palette is drawn directly from the region: rough-hewn native woods like Lenga and Coigüe, local stone for foundations and fireplaces, and accents of blackened steel.11 The interior design is characterized by its simplicity and warmth, featuring thick wool textiles (frazadas), leather, and a central hearth.12 A defining characteristic of Patagonian architecture is the duality of prospect and refuge. The structure must provide a cozy, protected interior while simultaneously featuring massive windows to frame the breathtaking views of mountains and lakes.13 This tension is central to the aesthetic. The AI prompt is specifically engineered to capture this duality, requesting both a warm interior and a grand exterior view, which is a more effective approach than simply listing materials.Data Implementation:code: 'rustico_patagonico'name: 'Rústico Patagónico'name_en: 'Patagonian Rustic'category: 'rustico'description: 'Un estilo que evoca un refugio en el sur de Chile.

Style: modernismo_andino (Modernismo Andino)Cultural Context: This style represents the cutting edge of Chilean architecture, a sophisticated and globally recognized aesthetic that remains deeply rooted in its local context. It is a form of modernism that is not cold or generic, but is instead textured, site-specific, and respectful of its Andean setting. It blends clean, minimalist lines with the raw materials and powerful geography of the mountains.Source Integration: This style embodies the "rougher," locally-interpreted modernism described by Chilean architects.7 It makes extensive use of board-formed concrete, large glass panes, and native woods, often in combination.6 The design philosophy is also influenced by the pre-Columbian Inca tradition of integrating architecture with the topography and using simple, powerful geometric forms.2 The inclusion of handcrafted elements, like a single Aymara textile or a piece of pottery, prevents the style from feeling sterile and anchors it in a rich artisanal tradition.18Data Implementation:code: 'modernismo_andino'name: 'Modernismo Andino'name_en: 'Andean Modernism'category: 'moderno'description: 'Minimalismo con identidad local.

Style: sur_chilote (Sur Mágico de Chiloé)Cultural Context: This style is entirely unique to the Chiloé archipelago, a product of its geographic isolation, maritime culture, and rich mythology. It is an architecture of wood, showcasing extraordinary carpentry skills passed down through generations. The style evokes a sense of coziness, craftsmanship, and a touch of the magical realism for which the island is famous.Source Integration: The style is a direct translation of Chilotan architecture. Key features include the use of distinctive wood shingles, often from the native Alerce tree, and construction techniques borrowed from shipbuilding, which are visible in the vaulted ceilings and complex joinery of the island's famous wooden churches.3 The palafito, or stilt house, built over the water, is an iconic dwelling type that defines the coastal landscape.3 Interiors are typically clad entirely in wood, creating a warm, enveloping, cabin-like feel.11Data Implementation:code: 'sur_chilote'name: 'Sur Mágico de Chiloé'name_en: 'Magical Chiloé'category: 'rustico'description: 'Inspirado en la arquitectura única de Chiloé.

Style: etnico_mapuche (Étnico Contemporáneo Mapuche)Cultural Context: This is a contemporary design style that respectfully and thoughtfully integrates the powerful aesthetics and symbolism of the Mapuche culture, the largest indigenous group in Chile. It is crucial that this style is not a caricature or a literal recreation of a traditional ruka (Mapuche house), but rather a modern interpretation that honors the spirit and artistry of the culture within a contemporary home.Source Integration: The style is built around key elements of Mapuche art and cosmology. The most prominent feature is the use of textiles with their bold, geometric patterns (known as ngümin) in a characteristic palette of red, black, and white.18 The design also incorporates the importance of silver (platería), which is used in traditional women's adornments like the trarilonko (headband) and trapelakucha (chest pendant), as subtle metallic accents.22 The overall feeling is earthy and connected to nature (mapu), using natural materials like wood, wool, and clay (greda).18Data Implementation:code: 'etnico_mapuche'name: 'Étnico Contemporáneo Mapuche'name_en: 'Contemporary Mapuche Ethnic'category: 'bohemio'description: 'Un estilo moderno que integra con respeto la rica simbología y estética de la cultura Mapuche, usando sus textiles, colores y materialidad.'base_prompt: 'A modern living room with a strong Mapuche influence.

Palette: atardecer_atacama (Atardecer en Atacama)Geographic Context: This palette is inspired by the dramatic daily spectacle of sunset in the Atacama Desert. As the sun dips below the horizon, the red rock formations, sand dunes, and distant volcanoes are bathed in an intense, warm light, creating a landscape of fiery reds, deep oranges, and earthy ochres.Source Integration: The dominant color of the Atacama is consistently described as red.10 This palette translates the visual experience of an Atacama sunset into a cohesive set of colors, drawing from descriptions of citrine brown, vivid tangelo, and yellow orange, which are characteristic of desert landscapes.24 The accent purple represents the color of the sky just after the sun has set, while the neutrals are derived from the white of the salt flats (salar) and the dark earth tones.Data Implementation:code: 'atardecer_atacama'name: 'Atardecer en Atacama'name_en: 'Atacama Sunset'mood: 'cálido'season: 'todo-el-año'primary_colors: ``accent_colors: [{"name": "Cielo Púrpura", "hex": "#764189"}]neutral_colors: ``3.2. Palette: glaciar_patagonia (Azul Glaciar Patagónico)Geographic Context: This palette captures the cool, crisp, and powerful colors of Southern Patagonia, particularly within Torres del Paine National Park. It is dominated by the intense, almost surreal blues of ancient glacial ice and the mineral-rich lakes they feed, contrasted with the stark grey of the granite mountains and the dark, rocky terrain.Source Integration: Patagonia is repeatedly identified with the color blue; the name of the park itself, "Paine," is the indigenous Tehuelche word for blue.10 The palette is built around the specific hues found in this environment: the milky, light blue of icebergs, the deep turquoise of Lake Pehoé, and the solid grey of the granite "towers".27 The neutrals reflect the pure white of fresh snow and the dark, almost black rock that forms the base of the mountains.Data Implementation:code: 'glaciar_patagonia'name: 'Azul Glaciar Patagónico'name_en: 'Patagonian Glacier Blue'mood: 'fresco'season: 'invierno'primary_colors: ``accent_colors: [{"name": "Nieve Pura", "hex": "#FFFFFF"}]neutral_colors: ``3.3.

It evokes the colors of a vineyard during the autumn harvest (vendimia), centered around Carmenere, Chile's signature red grape. The mood is sophisticated, warm, and rich, reflecting the quality and heritage of Chilean wine.Source Integration: The palette is built around the deep, purplish-red hue of Carmenere wine.33 This is complemented by the dark green of the vine leaves and the rich brown of the fertile soil.34 The accents and neutrals are drawn from other elements of the winemaking process: the pale, greenish-yellow of Muscat grapes, the warm tan of oak barrels, and the light brown of natural cork, creating a complete and evocative color story.36Data Implementation:code: 'vino_carmenere'name: 'Valle Central Carmenere'name_en: 'Central Valley Carmenere'mood: 'sofisticado'season: 'otoño'primary_colors: ``accent_colors: ``neutral_colors: ``3.5. Palette: lapislazuli_andino (Lapislázuli Andino)Cultural Context: This palette is derived from Chile's national stone, Lapis Lazuli, a semi-precious stone mined high in the Andes. The stone is prized for its intense deep blue color, often containing inclusions of golden pyrite and white calcite. This palette translates the mineral beauty of the stone into an elegant and luxurious color scheme.Source Integration: Lapis Lazuli is a recognized element in Chilean decor.9 The palette is constructed from the stone's characteristic colors. The primary colors are the deep cobalt and ultramarine blues that form the stone's matrix, along with the white of calcite veins.38 The essential accent color is a metallic gold, representing the flecks of pyrite that give the stone its signature sparkle.

Standard Rooms with Localized NamingMany rooms in a Chilean home use standard Spanish terms. However, there are nuances in common usage that the platform must reflect. For example, the Anglicism "Living" is extremely common and often used to refer to the primary, more formal living room where guests are received.41 The term Sala de Estar is also used, but frequently denotes a smaller, secondary, and more private family room, akin to a den. The platform should offer both to reflect this distinction. Similarly, a master bedroom is commonly referred to as Dormitorio Principal or Dormitorio en Suite, the latter being a prevalent term in Chilean real estate to signify a bedroom with an attached private bathroom.444.2. Chile-Specific Room TerminologyThe integration of uniquely Chilean domestic spaces is what will set the DECOLLAGE.CL platform apart. These terms are not mere vocabulary; they represent distinct cultural practices and architectural conventions.Logia: This is a fundamental term in modern Chilean apartments and houses. It refers to a specific, enclosed utility space, usually adjacent to the kitchen, that houses the washing machine, dryer, water heater, and cleaning supplies.46 It is distinct from a generic "laundry room" (lavadero) and its inclusion is a marker of deep local knowledge.Quincho: The quincho is a cornerstone of Chilean social life. It is a dedicated structure or area, which can range from a simple roofed patio to an elaborate enclosed space, built specifically for hosting an asado (barbecue).48 It always contains a parrilla (grill) and is a hub for family and social gatherings. Offering Quincho as a room type allows users to design for one of their most important social rituals.Bodega: While bodega can mean wine cellar, in a general domestic context in Chile, it refers to a storage room or locker, often located in the basement (sótano) or garage of a house or apartment building.35 It is the equivalent of a storage unit or cellar.By incorporating this specific lexicon, the application demonstrates an authentic understanding of the Chilean home, empowering users to design spaces that reflect their actual lives and cultural priorities.Section 5: seasonal_themes: Weaving Festivities into the User ExperienceThis section outlines the data for the seasonal_themes table. These themes are designed to align the application's content with the rhythm of Chilean cultural life, providing users with timely inspiration for decorating their homes during key national holidays and seasons. This strategy fosters ongoing engagement and makes the platform a relevant part of users' festive preparations.Table 5.1: Summary of Chilean Seasonal ThemescodenameActive PeriodDescriptionfiestas_patriasFiestas PatriasSeptember 1 - 30Celebrates Chile's independence with traditional decorations, food, and the national colors.navidad_veraniegaNavidad ChilenaDecember 1 - 31Captures the unique feeling of a summer Christmas in Chile, with specific foods and traditions.verano_costaVerano en la CostaDec 21 - Mar 20A theme celebrating the Chilean summer, inspired by the relaxed aesthetic of coastal beach houses.otono_vendimiaOtoño de VendimiaMar 21 - May 31An autumn theme inspired by the warm colors of the grape harvest (Vendimia) in Chile's wine valleys.5.1. Theme: fiestas_patrias (Fiestas Patrias)Cultural Context: Fiestas Patrias, centered around September 18th, is the most important national holiday in Chile, celebrating the nation's independence.52 The entire country engages in a week-long celebration characterized by fondas (fairgrounds), traditional cueca dancing, and ubiquitous asados.54 Homes and public spaces are universally decorated with the national colors.Source Integration: The theme's elements are drawn directly from these traditions. The color palette is the Chilean tricolor: red, white, and blue.56 Decorative elements include Chilean flags (banderines), tricolor garlands (guirnaldas), and the national flower, the copihue.58 The special AI prompt is designed to subtly incorporate iconic food items like empanadas de pino into the generated scene, adding a layer of festive authenticity.55Data Implementation:code: 'fiestas_patrias'name: 'Fiestas Patrias'description: 'Celebra el 18 de septiembre con los colores de Chile, guirnaldas y un ambiente de fonda.'start_date: '2025-09-01'end_date: '2025-09-30'theme_colors: {"primary":, "accent": ["#C59960"]}decoration_elements: ["guirnaldas tricolor", "banderines chilenos", "mantel de cuadros", "copihues rojos y blancos"]special_prompts: {"add": "A table in the background is set with empanadas de pino and a glass of red wine, festive atmosphere.", "style": "Celebratory and traditional Chilean style."}5.2. Theme: navidad_veraniega (Navidad Chilena)Cultural Context: Christmas in Chile occurs at the height of summer, leading to a unique blend of traditional northern hemisphere iconography and local, warm-weather adaptations. The celebration is centered on Christmas Eve (Noche Buena), with a late family dinner and gift opening at midnight.59Source Integration: The theme reflects this summer Christmas. Santa Claus is known as Viejito Pascuero (Old Man Christmas).61 While Christmas trees are common, they are almost always artificial due to the climate.59 The most distinctive elements are the food and drink: Pan de Pascua, a dense fruitcake, and Cola de Mono, a cold alcoholic beverage made with coffee, milk, and spices, are holiday staples.59 The special prompt incorporates these elements and the context of a sunny day outside the window to create a uniquely Chilean Christmas scene.Data Implementation:code: 'navidad_chilena'name: 'Navidad Chilena'description: 'El espíritu de una Navidad en verano.

Theme: otono_vendimia (Otoño de Vendimia)Cultural Context: This theme celebrates the autumn season (March to May) through the lens of one of Chile's most important cultural and economic activities: the grape harvest, or Vendimia. This period is marked by festivals in the central wine valleys and the turning of the leaves, creating a landscape of warm, rich colors.Source Integration: The theme draws inspiration from two key autumnal phenomena. The first is the Fiesta de la Vendimia, a series of festivals celebrating the grape harvest with wine tasting and traditional events.64 The second is the natural beauty of autumn, particularly in the south, where the leaves of Lenga and Ñirre trees turn brilliant shades of red, orange, and yellow.68 The color palette and decorative elements combine these two aspects, using the warm colors of autumn foliage and the deep burgundy of wine to create a cozy and sophisticated seasonal mood.Data Implementation:code: 'otono_vendimia'name: 'Otoño de Vendimia'description: 'Los colores cálidos del otoño y la vendimia en los valles de Chile.

The script is designed to be idempotent, meaning it can be run multiple times without creating duplicate entries or causing errors.6.1. Preamble and Execution NotesThe following SQL script contains INSERT statements for the design_styles, color_palettes, room_types, and seasonal_themes tables.Idempotency: Each INSERT statement includes an ON CONFLICT (code) DO NOTHING clause. This ensures that if a row with the same unique code already exists, the INSERT operation for that row will be skipped. This makes the script safe to run in development, staging, and production environments, even if some data has been manually inserted previously.Transactionality: It is highly recommended to wrap the entire execution of this script within a single database transaction. This ensures that all seeders are applied atomically; either all data is inserted successfully, or the entire operation is rolled back in case of an error, maintaining database integrity.JSON Formatting: The data for JSONB columns is provided as properly formatted and escaped JSON strings. Ensure that the database client executes these strings correctly.6.2. SQL Script for design_stylesSQL-- =============================================
