‚úª Thinking‚Ä¶

Great! The user has approved my comprehensive plan. Now I need to start implementing it. Looking at the plan,
the most critical first step is the database schema migration since the current schema doesn't match the new
comprehensive B2C-focused schema.

Let me start by using the TodoWrite tool to create a focused todo list for the immediate next steps, and then
begin with the schema migration work.

I should start with:
1. Create the todo list for Phase 1 (MUST HAVE items)
2. Begin with the database schema migration
3. Update TypeScript types
4. Create the Chilean cultural data seeders

Let me start with the TodoWrite tool to track this work.
