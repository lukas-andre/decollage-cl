## ✅ **M6: Project Management Improvements - COMPLETED**

### 1. **Fixed "Create New Project" Button** ✅
**Problem**: Button existed but wasn't functional - modal wasn't imported or rendered
**Solution**:
- Added missing `ProjectCreateModal` import to projects dashboard
- Implemented modal state management with `showCreateModal`
- Connected success handler to refresh projects list after creation
- Button now properly opens the creation modal and updates UI

**Files Modified**:
- `src/app/(dashboard)/dashboard/projects/page.tsx:20` - Added ProjectCreateModal import
- `src/app/(dashboard)/dashboard/projects/page.tsx:156-162` - Added modal component with handlers

### 2. **Added Image Deletion Capability** ✅
**Problem**: No way to delete images from project workspace
**Solution**:
- Implemented soft delete functionality with confirmation dialog
- Added delete button with Trash2 icon that appears on image hover
- Created Spanish confirmation dialog ("¿Eliminar imagen?")
- Updates UI state immediately after deletion
- Properly handles selected images cleanup

**Features Implemented**:
- Hover-based delete button with intuitive UX
- AlertDialog confirmation with proper Spanish text
- API integration with `/api/images/${imageId}` DELETE endpoint
- State management for immediate UI updates
- Selected image cleanup when deleted image was selected

**Files Modified**:
- `src/app/(dashboard)/dashboard/projects/[id]/page.tsx:45-60` - Added delete imports and confirmation dialog
- `src/app/(dashboard)/dashboard/projects/[id]/page.tsx:488-515` - Implemented handleDeleteImage function
- `src/app/(dashboard)/dashboard/projects/[id]/page.tsx:735-758` - Added delete button to image display

### 3. **Testing & Validation** ✅
**Results**:
- ✅ Development server running cleanly on port 3003
- ✅ No TypeScript errors (only unused import warnings)
- ✅ No runtime errors in console
- ✅ Both features working correctly
