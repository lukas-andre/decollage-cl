Project Plan & Architectural Blueprint: Social Sharing and Content Distribution for Decollage.clStrategic Framework & Foundational ArchitectureThis document outlines the comprehensive architectural design and implementation plan for the Social Sharing Infrastructure and Content Distribution Architecture for Decollage.cl. The following sections detail the strategic vision, core technical decisions, and foundational schemas necessary to build a scalable, performant, and SEO-optimized platform on a Next.js, Supabase, and Cloudflare technology stack.A Unified Vision for Content at Decollage.cl: "Cada Creación, una Galería"The foundational principle guiding this architecture is the strategic vision of treating every user's creation not as a transient entry in a feed, but as the centerpiece of its own dedicated micro-gallery. This philosophy, encapsulated by the motto "Cada Creación, una Galería" (Every Creation, a Gallery), dictates that each piece of user-generated content deserves a unique, aesthetically pleasing, and highly shareable digital space. This approach elevates the user's work, fosters a sense of ownership and pride, and transforms the platform from a simple content repository into a curated showcase of creativity.This vision directly informs the technical requirements. It necessitates an architecture capable of programmatically generating an infinite number of unique, beautiful, and performant web pages. Each page must be a self-contained experience, dynamically themed to complement the artwork it features, and equipped with tools that encourage both social sharing and community engagement. By investing in this premium presentation layer, Decollage.cl can create a powerful flywheel effect: high-quality presentation encourages sharing, which drives traffic and new user acquisition, leading to more high-quality content creation.The Hybrid Rendering Model: Optimizing for SEO, Speed, and ScaleThe single most critical architectural decision for the platform's long-term success is the choice of rendering strategy. Given the dynamic nature of user-generated content and the stringent requirements for performance and SEO, a hybrid rendering model within Next.js is the optimal solution. This approach allows for per-page optimization, using the best rendering strategy for each specific use case.1An analysis of the primary rendering options reveals their respective limitations for this project. Pure Static Site Generation (SSG), while offering exceptional performance, is unsuitable because it requires a full site rebuild for every new piece of content, a process that is operationally infeasible at scale.2 Conversely, a pure Server-Side Rendering (SSR) model, where every page is generated on the server at request time, would place a significant and continuous load on the server infrastructure. This would lead to increased hosting costs and potentially slower server response times, which can negatively impact both user experience and SEO rankings.3The recommended architecture therefore adopts a nuanced, hybrid approach:Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR) for Content Pages: The auto-generated "Galería de Creación" pages (e.g., /c/[creationId]) will be rendered using ISR. With ISR, the first time a specific creation's page is requested, Next.js will generate the page on the server, serve it to the user, and simultaneously cache a static HTML version at the edge via Cloudflare. All subsequent requests for that page will be served the lightning-fast, pre-rendered static file. A revalidate timer will be configured (e.g., every 60 minutes) to trigger a background regeneration of the page. This ensures that dynamic data, such as vote counts or comments, remains reasonably fresh without sacrificing the performance and scalability benefits of static hosting. This strategy perfectly balances the need for dynamic content with the SEO and speed advantages of pre-rendering.1Server-Side Rendering (SSR) for User-Centric Pages: Pages that display highly personalized and sensitive information, such as user dashboards, account settings, or private creation galleries, will utilize SSR. SSR generates the page on every request, ensuring that the data presented is always real-time and specific to the authenticated user.3 This is essential for security and for providing an accurate, up-to-the-moment user experience in private, authenticated sections of the application.This hybrid model leverages the full power of Next.js, transforming a potentially costly and slow dynamic content problem into a highly efficient and scalable static hosting problem, which is inherently cheaper, faster, and more resilient to traffic spikes.2Core Data Architecture in Supabase: A Schema for GrowthThe Supabase PostgreSQL database will serve as the single source of truth for the platform. The following schema is designed for relational integrity, performance, and extensibility, providing a solid foundation for the features outlined in this plan. It is structured to work seamlessly with Supabase's built-in features like Authentication, Storage, Row Level Security (RLS), and Realtime capabilities.5The schema will be managed declaratively using SQL migration files within the project repository, ensuring consistency between local development and production environments.6Key Database Tables:Table NameColumn NameData TypeConstraints / NotesusersiduuidPrimary Key. References auth.users.id.usernametextUnique, Not Null.avatar_urltextNullable. URL to user's profile picture.full_nametextNullable.created_attimestamptzNot Null.

Nullable (for anonymous shares).platformtextNullable. e.g., 'twitter', 'whatsapp', 'copy_link'.created_attimestamptzNot Null. Default now().This schema provides the necessary relations to track creations, their authors, and the engagement they generate. The use of jsonb for color_palette allows for flexible storage of structured color data without requiring a separate table.5 The votes table is optimized for the simple, singular reaction mechanic ("Aplausos") and is designed to integrate directly with Supabase's Realtime engine for live updates.7Leveraging the Edge: The Role of CloudflareCloudflare will serve as a critical component of the infrastructure, acting as the global distribution and security layer in front of the Next.js application and Supabase backend. Its role extends beyond simple hosting to encompass performance optimization, security, and cost management.Global Caching and Content Delivery Network (CDN): Cloudflare's primary function will be to cache the ISR-generated static pages and all static assets (images, JavaScript, CSS) at its numerous edge locations around the world. This ensures that users, regardless of their geographic location, experience minimal latency and near-instant load times.4 This is particularly crucial for serving the high-resolution 'before' and 'after' images.Image Optimization: While Next.js provides the excellent next/image component for basic optimization, Cloudflare Images can further enhance this process. It can automatically resize images on the fly, compress them, and serve them in modern, efficient formats like WebP or AVIF to supported browsers. This reduces bandwidth consumption and accelerates page loads, a key factor in both user experience and SEO rankings.9Security: Cloudflare will provide a robust first line of defense for the entire application. Its Web Application Firewall (WAF) will protect against common web vulnerabilities, and its DDoS mitigation capabilities will ensure the platform remains available even during large-scale attacks. This secures both the Next.js frontend and the Supabase API endpoints from malicious traffic.By offloading traffic and security concerns to Cloudflare's edge network, the core application servers can focus on their primary tasks: generating pages and serving API requests, leading to a more stable, secure, and performant platform.Feature Deep Dive: The Social Sharing InfrastructureThis section details the features and technical implementations required to make content from Decollage.cl highly engaging and effective when shared across social media platforms, messaging apps, and the wider web.Dynamic Social Cards: "Tu Creación, Tu Tarjeta de Visita"The single most impactful feature for driving click-through rates and establishing brand presence on social media is the dynamic generation of rich, branded Open Graph (OG) images. When a user shares a link to a creation, the platform must provide a compelling visual preview—a digital business card ("Tarjeta de Visita") for that creation.Technical Implementation:This will be achieved using Next.js's built-in support for dynamic OG image generation within the App Router.11Route Handler: A special file, opengraph-image.tsx, will be created within the dynamic route segment (e.g., app/c/[creationId]/opengraph-image.tsx). This file exports a function that Next.js will execute on the server to generate an image.Image Generation with ImageResponse: Inside this file, the ImageResponse constructor from the next/og library will be used. This powerful API allows for the rendering of a React component, written with standard JSX and a subset of CSS (primarily Flexbox), directly into a PNG image stream.11Dynamic Content: The exported function will receive the creationId from the URL parameters. It will use this ID to fetch the corresponding creation's data from Supabase (e.g., the 'after' image URL, title, and the author's username and avatar). This data will then be passed as props to a dedicated React component (e.g., <OGCardTemplate {...creationData} />).Branded Template: The OGCardTemplate component will be meticulously designed to align with Decollage.cl's brand guidelines. It will incorporate the brand's logo, fonts, and color scheme, and will artfully arrange the dynamic content to create a visually appealing and informative social card. This ensures brand consistency and a professional appearance for every shared link.13Scalability and Performance Strategy:Generating an image is a computationally intensive process. To prevent server overload if a piece of content goes viral and its OG image is requested thousands of times, a "generate-once, cache-forever" strategy will be implemented.Asynchronous Generation: Upon the successful creation of a new entry in the creations table, a Supabase Database Function (or Edge Function) will be triggered.Image Creation and Storage: This function will invoke a secure, internal API endpoint in the Next.js application. This endpoint's sole responsibility is to execute the ImageResponse logic and generate the OG image. The resulting image will be uploaded directly to Supabase Storage.URL Update: Once uploaded, the public URL of the newly created OG image in Supabase Storage will be written back to the og_image_url column in the corresponding creations table row.Static Serving: The generateMetadata function for the public creation page will then use this static, globally-cached og_image_url for the <meta property="og:image"> tag. This approach ensures that all subsequent share requests serve a static image file directly from the CDN, making the system incredibly resilient, scalable, and cost-effective.14Engagement Mechanics: "Reacciones que Inspiran"To foster a vibrant community and provide creators with positive feedback, a simple yet effective real-time reaction system will be implemented. Instead of a generic "like," this feature will be branded as "Aplausos" (Applause), aligning with the creative and celebratory nature of the platform.Database and Security:The foundation of this system is the votes table in Supabase, as defined in the core architecture. It will store a record for each unique user-creation pair. To prevent abuse, strict Row Level Security (RLS) policies will be enforced 7:An INSERT policy will allow authenticated users to add a vote for any creation, but only with their own user_id.A SELECT policy will allow all users (including anonymous ones) to read the vote counts.UPDATE and DELETE policies will be highly restrictive, perhaps only allowing a user to delete their own vote within a certain time frame.Real-Time Updates with Supabase Realtime:To provide an engaging, instantaneous user experience, the vote count will update in real-time for all viewers of a creation page without requiring a page refresh. This will be achieved using Supabase's highly efficient Realtime Broadcast functionality, avoiding the need for inefficient client-side polling.8Postgres Trigger: A trigger will be attached to the votes table. This trigger will fire after any INSERT or DELETE operation.Broadcast Function: The trigger will execute a PL/pgSQL function. This function will use the realtime.broadcast_changes() helper to send a payload over a private, specific channel. The channel name will be dynamically constructed based on the creation_id (e.g., creations-votes:${creation_id}). The payload will contain the new total vote count for that creation.Client-Side Subscription: On the Next.js creation page, the Supabase client library will be used to subscribe to the relevant channel for the creation being viewed. The component will listen for new broadcast events on this channel.UI Update: When a new message containing the updated vote count is received, the component's state will be updated, and the UI will re-render instantly to reflect the new "Aplausos" count. This creates a lively and interactive experience, encouraging users to participate.15Share Analytics & Link ManagementTo provide valuable feedback to creators and the platform itself, a basic analytics system will be implemented to track sharing activity.Implementation:When a user interacts with a share button (e.g., "Share to X," "Copy Link"), an event will be logged in the shares table. This record will capture the creation_id, the user_id of the sharer (if authenticated), and the target platform.To further enhance tracking, unique query parameters can be appended to the shared URL (e.g., ?utm_source=decollage_share&utm_medium=twitter&share_id=<unique_share_id>). This allows for more granular analysis of traffic sources and can help identify which platforms and which users are the most effective drivers of content virality. This data is invaluable for future feature development, such as creating leaderboards for the most-shared creations or identifying "super-sharer" users for community rewards.Feature Deep Dive: The Content Distribution ArchitectureThis section focuses on the on-site presentation of user-generated content, detailing the architecture for the automatically generated pages that form the core of the user experience.The Auto-Generated Page Template: "Galería de Creación"Each public creation will have its own dedicated, permanent URL, structured as a dynamic route in Next.js (e.g., /c/[creationId]). This page serves as the "Galería de Creación" and will be the primary destination for shared links and organic search traffic.Page Structure and Components:The page will be built as a server component in Next.js, fetching all necessary data for a given creationId from Supabase during the ISR process. It will be composed of several modular React components:CreatorHeader: Displays the creator's avatar, username, and the creation's title and timestamp.CreationShowcase: The main content area, featuring the interactive "Antes y Después" slider.CreationDetails: A section containing the user-provided description and any associated tags.EngagementPanel: A client-side component that includes the real-time "Aplausos" button and counter, along with the primary sharing buttons. This component will handle the subscription to Supabase Realtime.CallToActionFooter: A section encouraging visitors to create their own account and start their own projects on Decollage.cl.This component-based architecture ensures a clean separation of concerns, facilitates code reuse, and allows for easier maintenance and future enhancements.Dynamic Theming via Color Extraction: "Armonía Visual Automática"To realize the vision of "Cada Creación, una Galería," each page must feel unique and visually tailored to the artwork it displays. This will be achieved through an innovative automated theming system that extracts a color palette from the user's final image and applies it to the page's UI elements.Technical Implementation:This process will be fully automated and triggered upon image upload.Trigger: A Supabase Edge Function will be invoked whenever a new row is inserted into the creations table.Image Processing: The Edge Function will receive the after_image_url. It will then fetch the image data from Supabase Storage.Color Extraction: The function will use a lightweight, server-side compatible JavaScript library like colorthief to analyze the image pixels.16 This library can efficiently identify the most prominent colors in an image. Alternative libraries such as extract-colors or @dominate-color.js/core also provide robust functionality for this task.18 The function will extract a palette of key colors, such as a dominant color, a vibrant accent, and a muted background color.Palette Storage: The extracted palette will be stored as a JSONB object in the color_palette column of the creations table. A typical palette might look like: {"primary": "#1A2B3C", "accent": "#D4AF37", "background": "#F5F5F5"}.Dynamic Styling: When the /c/[creationId] page is rendered via ISR, it fetches this color_palette object along with the other creation data. These color values are then injected into the page's root element as CSS custom properties (variables). For example: <main style="--theme-primary: #1A2B3C; --theme-accent: #D4AF37;">.Themed CSS: The page's stylesheet will be authored to use these CSS variables for key UI elements like button backgrounds, link colors, section borders, and text highlights. This allows the entire page's color scheme to adapt automatically and harmoniously to the user's artwork, creating a bespoke and professional-looking gallery page for every single creation.This feature is a significant differentiator, elevating the platform's perceived quality and providing a delightful experience that encourages users to share their beautifully presented work.Showcasing Transformation: The "Antes y Después" SliderThe core narrative of Decollage.cl is transformation. The most effective way to showcase this is with an interactive "Antes y Después" (Before and After) image comparison slider. This component allows visitors to engage directly with the content by sliding a divider to reveal the changes between the two images.Library Selection and Implementation:A well-maintained, lightweight, and accessible React component is essential for this feature. Based on community adoption, feature set, and performance, react-compare-slider is a strong candidate.20 It has zero dependencies, a small bundle size, and supports accessibility features like keyboard navigation. Other viable options include react-before-after-slider-component and react-compare-image.20The chosen component will be integrated into the CreationShowcase module. It will be configured to be fully responsive, adapting to the parent container's width, and will receive the before_image_url and after_image_url from the creation's data as props. The styling of the slider handle and divider will be customized to match the overall brand aesthetic of Decollage.cl.A Comprehensive SEO Implementation PlanEnsuring that every auto-generated creation page is highly discoverable by search engines is paramount to driving organic traffic and growth. The choice of ISR provides a solid foundation by serving pre-rendered HTML that is easily crawlable by bots.1 This will be augmented by a multi-faceted SEO strategy.Dynamic Metadata: The generateMetadata function in Next.js will be used within the dynamic page component (/c/[creationId]/page.tsx).11 This server-side function will fetch the specific creation's data (title, description, author's username) before the page is rendered and dynamically construct unique and descriptive metadata for each page.Title Tag: <title> por [Username] | Decollage.cl</title>Meta Description: <meta name="description" content="[First 155 characters of creation description]...">This ensures every page has unique, relevant metadata, which is a critical factor for search engine ranking.9Structured Data (JSON-LD): A <script type="application/ld+json"> tag will be embedded in the page's <head>. This script will contain structured data using the schema.org vocabulary, specifically the CreativeWork or ImageObject schema. It will programmatically include details like the author, title, a description, and the image URL. This helps search engines like Google understand the content and context of the page, significantly increasing the likelihood of appearing as a "rich snippet" in search results, which can dramatically improve click-through rates.9Canonical URLs: To prevent duplicate content issues, a canonical link tag (<link rel="canonical" href="...">) will be dynamically generated for each page. This tag will point to the definitive, clean URL for the creation (e.g., https://decollage.cl/c/123-abc), signaling to search engines that this is the master version of the page to index.10Sitemap Generation: An automated, server-side process will be implemented to generate and maintain a sitemap.xml file. This can be achieved using a library like next-sitemap or a custom script that runs periodically (e.g., via a cron job). The sitemap will list the URLs of all public creation pages, ensuring that search engine crawlers can efficiently discover and index all user-generated content, especially new additions.9robots.txt: A robots.txt file will be configured in the public directory to provide instructions to web crawlers, disallowing them from indexing non-public areas of the site (like user settings or admin panels) and providing the location of the sitemap.xml file.22The Complete Project BacklogThe following table translates the architectural and feature specifications into a prioritized, actionable project backlog.

These features, initially marketed under the "Momentos Mágicos" (Magic Moments) banner and marked as "Próximamente" (Coming Soon), will provide creators with powerful new tools to showcase their work.Concept: AI-Generated Video Shorts from CreationsThe flagship feature of the "Momentos Mágicos" suite will be the one-click generation of short, dynamic videos from a user's static 'before' and 'after' images.User Value Proposition: "Transforma tu creación estática en un video corto y dinámico, perfecto para compartir en Reels, TikTok y Stories." (Transform your static creation into a short, dynamic video, perfect for sharing on Reels, TikTok, and Stories.)This feature addresses the growing demand for video content on social media. It empowers users who may lack video editing skills to create engaging, professional-looking animations that highlight their creative process. The generated video (e.g., 5-8 seconds) could feature cinematic effects like a slow pan, a crossfade reveal, or an animated slider effect, complete with a title card and a branded Decollage.cl outro.Technical Feasibility & Recommended Approach: RemotionWhile various AI video generation APIs exist, such as Google's Veo 3, they are primarily designed for text-to-video generation and offer limited control over the final output's branding, animation, and structure.23 For this specific use case, a programmatic video creation framework provides the necessary precision and control.Recommendation: RemotionRemotion is the ideal technology for this feature as it allows developers to create videos programmatically using React.25 This aligns perfectly with the existing technology stack and the development team's skillset. With Remotion, video templates are simply React components that can be parameterized and rendered on a server.26Implementation Plan:Template Development: The team will develop a series of Remotion <Composition> components. Each composition will be a different video template (e.g., "Fade Reveal," "Wipe Transition," "Ken Burns Effect"). These components will be designed to accept props, such as the before_image_url, after_image_url, title, and even the color_palette to ensure the video's theme matches the creation's page.27Server-Side Rendering Infrastructure: A server-side rendering environment for Remotion will be established. This can be a dedicated Node.js server or, for better scalability, a serverless architecture using Remotion Lambda on AWS.28User Flow: A premium user will click a "Crear Video Mágico" button on their creation page. This action will trigger a request to the backend.Rendering Process: The backend will queue a rendering job, passing the creation's data to the Remotion rendering engine. The engine will programmatically render the chosen React video template frame-by-frame into a final MP4 file.29Delivery: The completed MP4 video will be uploaded to Supabase Storage. The user will be notified when their video is ready, and a link to download or share the video will be provided.Phased Rollout StrategyA phased approach will be used to launch this premium feature, allowing for iterative development, feedback collection, and anticipation building.Phase 1 (Post-MVP Launch): A disabled button or a promotional banner for "Momentos Mágicos" will be added to the creation page UI, labeled "Próximamente." This will gauge user interest and build excitement for the upcoming feature.Phase 2 (Closed Beta): A single, polished Remotion video template will be developed. The feature will be enabled for a select group of power users or early adopters. Their feedback on video quality, style, and overall experience will be invaluable for refinement.Phase 3 (Public Launch): The feature will be launched publicly as a premium offering.
